# Sortify
## About
Sortify is a small GUI based program developed by me, which uses your spotify extended streaming history to show you your top tracks/artists.
## Get Started
to get started request your [extended streaming history](https://www.spotify.com/ca-en/account/privacy/), when you recieve your data download and extract them, then download the latest version of [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Sortify.py](https://github.com/IDGBAN/Sortify/blob/main/Sortify.py), run it, and press the *Run Analysis* button. From your Spotify data Select the json files you want included in your statistics. This shouldn't take long to process unless your data is huge or your computer is very old.
